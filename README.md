# edu_ranking_analysis
For personal purpose the dataset is not given.

Educational ranking analysis with Python is still going on.
For now the uploaded code is to handle the dataset as Descriptive Analysis.
Futher codes for data modelling and feature engineering will be upload when I finish it.
(And also visualization with PowerBI/Tableau)
